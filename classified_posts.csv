"The main reason I deleted Duolingo was because I was sick of the owl gaslighting me.

Then when that failed, it would try to appeal to me with its whole &quot;I miss you!&quot; tactic. App notifications were like getting texts from a manipulative girlfriend/boyfriend.Now, throw AI in there, I can&#39;t really imagine why people would still consider it. Token-based or Markov-style algorithms can never be 100% accurate; it&#39;s a fundamental baked into that branch of predictive mathematics--it&#39;s probables, i.e. &quot;It is probably x with varying confidence intervals.&quot; So, yeah, I&#39;m not surprised users are reporting a large drop in quality. People put way too much faith in generative AI without first understanding the fundamentals and/or mathematical principles behind it. Even a model with 99% accuracy--which sound great--is pretty woeful and results in a lot of mistakes that could be anything from minor to critical with no controlling that. Generating a language plan at a very generous 99% would still mean half a million Duolingo users got a defective plan.A moronic thing to base a business on, especially when accuracy/quality is a fundamental requirement of the product&#39;s existence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEue-CvyRoA,quality concerns,Critical

Be it sell their 20,000 shares all at once (Crashing the stock hard and immediately which then has a snowball effect), make claims to the government that the company isn&#39;t &quot;protecting my assets like the law says they should&quot;, or whatever else exists as a weapon that scheming investors do to force investment growth above all else.There are no Governmental protections codified into law that protects companies from Crony Capitalists (if you don&#39;t know what that is, it means the evil side of capitalism. Capitalism in itself is not bad, it&#39;s people that take advantage of good people that make it look as bad as it does to some). They can do all of these tricks and schemes to force compliance from these companies into whatever they tell them to do, or the companies go under fighting against the investor&#39;s whims.If we could have laws that protected companies (Only to an extent) that read somewhere along the line of, &quot;If investor ideas run the risk of damaging the company outright, Going against said investors does not breach Investor integrity laws. By a company denying &quot;advised actions&quot; given to them by investors occur, the investors cannot pull more than 10% of there held stocks at any given moment or within the next 300 days. If they are threatening to sell all of their stock, or their is a suspicion that they may to damage the company, the company has the right to sue the investor for their stocks back in which they will purchase them back for a fair (Either agreed upon or court ordered) price and doing so will also ban the individual or entity the right to buy stocks from that IPO in the future for no less than 10 years.&quot;It&#39;s a very basic idea that i&#39;ve had for a while, but for many some-what &quot;good&quot; companies that still kinda give a crap about their reputation with their customers, it would be a defense against malicious actors that don&#39;t care if the company survives longer than 5 years or not after their initial IPO open.

"It really didn&#39;t bother me that they were gonna use AI, considering that the AI part was just the voices of the characters in the app. What really made my view of them much worse than before is putting useful stuff behind a paywall. Before they had hearts that actually made you to be weary and aware of what you learn, and you could replenish them by doing practices. It was tedious but nevertheless, made you practice with it. Now they completely removed that. You can&#39;t practice to earn more hearts anymore, and a health bar every time you answer a question depletes. This is just plain greedy at this point.
